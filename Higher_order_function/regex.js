/* 
Regex patterns are made up of a combination of characters and special symbols. 
The most basic regex pattern is a simple string of characters. For example, the 
pattern "hello" would match the string "hello" in a text document. We will look into 
many of such patterns in further lectures.
Regex also supports the use of character classes, which we will be looking further, 
it allows you to match a specific set of characters. For example, the character 
class "[a-z]" will match any lowercase letter. Additionally, regex provides a 
number of special character sequences, such as \d to match any digit, \s to 
match any whitespace, and \w to match any word character
